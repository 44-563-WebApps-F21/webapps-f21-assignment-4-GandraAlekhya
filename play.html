        <h3>An Ideal Husband</h3>
        <h4>_Same as Act II_  
            [LORD GORING _is standing by the fireplace with his hands in his
            pockets_.  _He is looking rather bored_.].</h4>

        [LORD GORING _is standing by the fireplace with his hands in his
        pockets_.  _He is looking rather bored_.]
        <br>
        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6>
         <p>[_Pulls out his watch_, _inspects it_, _and rings the
            bell_.] </p> 
            <p>It is a great nuisance.  I can’t find any one in this house to
            talk to.  And I am full of interesting information.  I feel like the
            latest edition of something or other.</p> 
        <br>
        <p>[_Enter servant_.]</p>
        <br>
        <h6>JAMES. </h6> 
        <p> Sir Robert is still at the Foreign Office, my lord.</p>
        <br>
        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6> 
        <p>Lady Chiltern not down yet?</p>
        <br>
        <h6>JAMES.</h6> 
        <p>Her ladyship has not yet left her room.  Miss Chiltern has just
            come in from riding.</p> 
        <br>
        <h6> LORD GORING.</h6> 
        <p>[_To himself_.]</p>
         <p> Ah! that is something.</p> 
            
        <br>
        <h6>JAMES.</h6>
         <p>Lord Caversham has been waiting some time in the library for Sir</p> 
        <h6>Robert.</h6>
         <p>I told him your lordship was here.</p> 
        <br>
        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6> 
        <p>Thank you!  Would you kindly tell him I’ve gone?</p> 
        <br>
        <h6>JAMES.</h6> 
        <p> [_Bowing_.]</p>
             <p> I shall do so, my lord.</p>
        <br>
       <p>[_Exit servant_.]</p> 
        <br>
        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6> 
        <p>Really, I don’t want to meet my father three days running.
            It is a great deal too much excitement for any son.  I hope to goodness
            he won’t come up.  Fathers should be neither seen nor heard.  That is the
            only proper basis for family life.  Mothers are different.  Mothers are
            darlings. </p> 
            <p>[_Throws himself down into a chair_, _picks up a paper and
            begins to read it_.]</p> 
        <br>
        [_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]
        <br>
        <h6>LORD CAVERSHAM.</h6>
         <p> Well, sir, what are you doing here?  Wasting your time
            as usual, I suppose?</p>
        <br>
        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6>
         <p>[_Throws down paper and rises_.] </p>
             <p> My dear father, when one
            pays a visit it is for the purpose of wasting other people’s time, not
            one’s own.</p> 
        <br>
        <h6>LORD CAVERSHAM.</h6>
         <p>Have you been thinking over what I spoke to you about
            last night?</p>
            <br>  
        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6> 
        <p>I have been thinking about nothing else.</p> 
        <br>
        <h6>LORD CAVERSHAM.</h6> 
        <p>Engaged to be married yet?</p> 
        <br>
        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6>
         <p>[_Genially_.] </p>
             <p> Not yet: but I hope to be before lunch-time. </p>
